# Few words about me
My name is Żaneta Gieroń. PhD student at University of Silesia, Institute of Biology, Biotechnology and Environmental Protection since 2017. I obtained a master's degree in biotechnology with an excellent grade and the Rector's of the University of Silesia recommendation, thanks to which I started my PhD studies. Thanks to my academic experience, I developed an analytical mindset, which allowed me to easily develop in the field of automated software testing. I am an open person, striving for continuous development. Challenging myself gives me the opportunity to learn new things over and over again.
